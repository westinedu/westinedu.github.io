      description: `
        <strong>Analyzing Stock Trends</strong> is a foundational practice in technical analysis, aiming to identify the direction and strength of price movements over time.
        By studying historical price data, traders attempt to detect <em>uptrends</em>, <em>downtrends</em>, or <em>sideways consolidation</em> that can inform buying or selling decisions.
        <br><br>
        📊 Key techniques include:<br>
        • Trend lines (support & resistance)<br>
        • Moving averages (SMA, EMA)<br>
        • Momentum indicators (RSI, MACD)<br>
        • Volume confirmation<br><br>

      description: `
        <strong>Trend Identification</strong> is the process of recognizing the prevailing market direction — whether bullish, bearish, or neutral.
        A trend is defined by a series of higher highs and higher lows (uptrend), or lower highs and lower lows (downtrend).
        <br><br>
        🔍 Core methods include:<br>
        • <strong>Price Action Analysis</strong>: visual inspection of chart movements<br>
        • <strong>Moving Averages</strong>: smoothing techniques to confirm longer-term direction<br>
        • <strong>Breakouts</strong>: identifying key levels where trends accelerate<br><br>
        💡 Confirmation requires multiple time frames and often volume validation.<br>
