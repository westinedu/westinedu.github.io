          "moreDescription": "Rising U.S. import tariffs have ripple effects across the entire economy. When tariffs increase (from 0% toward 100%), they act as a tax on traded goods, affecting prices, output, and financial markets. This deep-dive report presents an interactive causal visualization and analysis of how higher tariffs influence key macroeconomic indicators: international trade volume, inflation (CPI), corporate earnings & investment, overall GDP, the stock market, and household income & consumption. The goal is to make complex economic interdependencies intuitive – using a radial causal graph with a tariff-level slider – while grounding each link in solid economic theory and empirical evidence. By adjusting the tariff slider, users can observe dynamic changes  and access brief explanations for each causal link. The accompanying written analysis explains the theory (e.g. supply chain disruptions, deadweight loss, retaliation) and cites evidence from sources like the IMF, World Bank, WTO, Fed, OECD, and BEA to quantify these effects. This is a storytelling tool  to explore the economic impact of tariff policy in an engaging yet rigorous way."
