When tariffs increase (from 0% toward 100%), they act as a tax on traded goods, affecting prices, output, and financial markets. This deep-dive report presents an <strong data-start=\"320\" data-end=\"356\">interactive causal visualization</strong> and analysis of how higher tariffs influence key macroeconomic indicators: international trade volume, inflation (CPI), corporate earnings &amp; investment, overall GDP, the stock market, and household income &amp; consumption. The goal is to make complex economic interdependencies intuitive – using a radial causal graph with a tariff-level slider – while grounding each link in solid economic theory and empirical evidence. By adjusting the tariff slider, users can observe dynamic changes&nbsp; and access brief explanations for each causal link. The accompanying written analysis explains the theory (e.g. supply chain disruptions, deadweight loss, retaliation) and cites evidence from sources like the IMF, World Bank, WTO, Fed, OECD, and BEA to quantify these effects.

Businesses either have to absorb the cost (lower profits) or pass it to consumers (risking lower sales).

Tariffs might save some jobs in protected industries (e.g. some factory jobs if production shifts onshore), but they can also reduce jobs in industries that face higher input costs or export losses. The net employment effect of tariffs is theoretically ambiguous, but in practice studies often find either small negatives or no large positives. For instance, one analysis found the 2018 tariffs had essentially no net impact on overall U.S. manufacturing employment – jobs gained in steel were offset by jobs lost in metal-using sectors. Meanwhile, jobs in farming and freight may have been lost due to export declines. If tariffs ultimately lead to even a slight increase in unemployment or slower job growth, that hurts household incomes further.
